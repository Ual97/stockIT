# stockIT
Our goal is to create a easy to use, scalable inventory management system.  
If you’re not paying attention to your inventory, how much product you have available, re-ordering needs, etc, you can easily be wasting your money on products no one wants while missing  opportunities to offer the products your customers are most excited about.  

### Functionalities
- User email registration and verification
- Add and update products
- Add and update branches
- Manage your inventory stock of products
- See all your inventory stock, or filter it by branch
- Add and consult product movements (adding or deleting a product from a branch)
- CSV or Excel file bulk upload of products, branches, and movements
- QR or barcode generation and scanning for products
- Charts generated by movements and inventory data
